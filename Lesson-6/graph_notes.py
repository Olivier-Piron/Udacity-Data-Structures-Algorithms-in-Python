# A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as 
# vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph can be 
# defined as,

# A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.

# Edges can have a direction, the relationship between two nodes only apply one way

#  Tree are a type of graph
# A tree is a finite set of one or more nodes such that –
# - There is a specially designated node called root.
# - The remaining nodes are partitioned into n>=0 disjoint sets T1, T2, T3, …, Tn
# where T1, T2, T3, …, Tn is called the subtrees of the root.
