# For example, inserting into a list is easy (happens in constant time). 
# However, inserting into an array is O(n), since you may need to shift elements to make space for the one 
# you're inserting, or even copy everything to a new array if you run out of space. Thus, inserting into a 
# Python list is actually O(n), while operations that search for an element at a particular spot are O(1). 
# You can see the runtime of other list operations here.

# Python is a "higher level" programming language, so you can accomplish a task with little code. 
# However, there's a lot of code built into the infrastructure in this way that causes your code to actually 
# run much more slowly than you'd think. 

# The runtime to find the length of a python liwt is O(1)
